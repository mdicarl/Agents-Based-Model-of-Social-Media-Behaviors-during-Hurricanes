# Agents-Based-Model-of-Social-Media-Behaviors-during-Hurricanes


Agents-Based Modelling (ABM) can demonstrate the effects of human behavior on system dynamics. This application of agents-based modelling demonstrates the complex interactions on social media networks that can emerge under the pressure of a hazard event. We assess different settings of model-level variables for outcomes in the number of agents helped, reposting and going to help. The variables explored include network size, average number of connections between nodes, and the average rate at which the hazard event distributes damages.
